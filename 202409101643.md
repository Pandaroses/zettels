This approach, which pairs effectively with the Pareto principle, led to notable academic achievements, including a fourth-place ranking in computer science and commendable results across various subjects.*

*Motivated by these outcomes, I developed Cyclic, a suite of applications that integrates retrospective revision with machine learning algorithms to improve students's revision schedules and efficacy. This project not only improved my programming skills but also introduced me to advanced concepts in algorithm analysis. My subsequent exploration of Big O notation and comprehensive study of the CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms) textbook substantially deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithmic efficiency.*
