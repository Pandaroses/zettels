i love learning -> passion in learning -> retrospective revision -> combined with FSRS & Pomodoro to yap -> i made app -> also added cool exam spacing -> through the project i used sql and rust, my personal favourites, yada yada yada i read about how databases are cool, maybe about ACID compliant databases / ORM being awesome or whatever.

pendulum. 

intro about n-tuple pendulum, deriving a double pendulum on my own following a physics lesson on harmonic motion -> read about euler lagrange equations of motion and used eulers method to implement it in code. i created the n-tuple based on travis taylors approach, which used matrix manipulation to estimate the motion of the pendulum, additionally i implemented the RK4 method for increased accuracy -> aware that the rk4 method was still susceptible to energy loss, i read bornanas paper on a generalized equation for pendulums, which yada yada yada proof by induction and considered the fact that it solves the fact that partial derivatives are innacurate when solved by computational methods. this is cool and all yada yada yada



Participating in Arm work experience, we were tasked with developing a mock project to develop essential team-building and problem-solving skills. I was in charge of creating a standard for inter-satellite proximity detection and data transfer using the micro:bit's radio modules. After reviewing feedback from multiple groups and other team members, I implemented changes to improve the proximity detection, changing from high-power radio strength analysis to a lower-power method with a more limited range but a more accurate distance estimate. The skills I learned, particularly in understanding a client's needs, proved useful when I co-founded a freelancing company with my peers, mainly focusing on *B2B* software development, [FINISH YAP?]

Community service is a core value of mine. As an explorer scout, I shared my passion for education by teaching during electronics nights or helping with Digital Maker badges. In addition, I helped renovate the scout building, ensuring it will serve as a safe and secure place for future activities. Furthermore, my role as a volunteer organizer for Robocon, a student-led robotics competition, involved website maintenance and the development of websocket code for live robot video feeds. During the competition, I interacted with industry professionals, especially the software developers at Redgate, where I learned about the implementation of safe SQL migrations and provided valuable insights into computer science as a career.
