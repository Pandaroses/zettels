### vectors

a vector is defined either by  
$$ \vec{r} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ \vdots \\ n \end{bmatrix}$$
or by 
$$ \vec{r} = ai + bj + ck + ... + zn $$
 both definitions are used, I personally prefer the top one as its more intuitive, but the vector product uses the second definition as a [insert proof], so i guess thats a thing.

### direction vectors
a direction vector is written as 
$$ \vec{r} = \vec{a} + \lambda \vec{b} $$

## the dot product
the dot product is used to calculate the angle between two vectors,  or it can be used to figure out the minimum distance between two skew lines, which would be when they are perpendicular.

### the formulae
$a \cdot b =a_xb_x + a_yb_y +...+ a_nb_n = |a||b|cos\theta$

### use cases
when two vectors are $\perp$ , the dot product is 0, as the angle = $\frac{\pi}{2}$

## the scalar product

#todo understand



the area of a triangle is 
$$ 1/2|a||b| sin(\theta) $$
and $$ a \ \times \ b = |a||b|sin(\theta)\eta$$
so the area of a traingle is $$\frac{1}{2}|a \times b|$$
