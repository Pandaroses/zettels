I love learning. I go out of my way to thoroughly understand topics we cover in class or interesting things I discover while working on projects. I'm interested in optimizing the learning process. I love trying to explain complex topics in bite-sized chunks. After reading about the retrospective revision method and successfully using it for my personal exam preparation, I was curious if it could be combined with other methods of study, such as the FSRS algorithm and the Pomodoro technique. This led me to develop an app to help students revise efficiently and reduce stress. I also implemented exam spacing, to help students effectively distribute limited practice questions. The results of a trial with a cohort of students demonstrated improved time utilization and higher knowledge retention. In further studies, I would like to create novel tools or methods, leveraging modern technologies, that enhance the quality of education across diverse fields. 

Developing an n-tuple pendulum simulation made me think about the interdisciplinary skills gained with computer science. Initially having covered harmonic motion in a physics lesson and hearing about double pendulums, which are one of the simplest examples of chaotic motion, I did further research on the topic by looking into Euler-Lagrange equations of motion and the Runge Kutta methods for estimating differential equations. I was impressed by Boran Yesilyurt's paper about generalized equations of motion for n-tuple pendulums, as his derivation was a novel solution to the problem of partial derivatives being inaccurate when solved by computational methods. Additionally, seeing proof by induction being used in physics, which I had recently learned during my Further Maths lessons, was fascinating. I ultimately decided to follow Travis Taylor's approach, which used matrix and vector manipulation to estimate the motion of an n-tuple pendulum. In this project iteration, I implemented the RK4 method instead of Euler's method for increased accuracy, although still susceptible to energy loss. This project demonstrated to me, that computing is a valuable tool, allowing scientists to convert abstract mathematical models into tangible simulations.

Participating in Arm work experience, we were tasked with developing a mock project to develop essential team-building and problem-solving skills. I was in charge of creating a standard for inter-satellite proximity detection and data transfer using the micro:bit's radio modules. After reviewing feedback from multiple groups and other team members, I implemented changes to improve the proximity detection, changing from high-power radio strength analysis to a lower-power method with a more limited range but a more accurate distance estimate. The skills I learned, particularly in understanding a client's needs, proved useful when I co-founded a freelancing company with my peers, mainly focusing on *B2B* software development, [YAP]

Community service is a core value of mine. As an explorer scout, I shared my passion for education by teaching during electronics nights or helping with Digital Maker badges. In addition, I helped renovate the scout building, ensuring it will serve as a safe and secure place for future  activities. Furthermore, my role as a volunteer organizer for Robocon, a student-led robotics competition, involved website maintenance and the development of websocket code for live robot video feeds. During the competition, I interacted with industry professionals, especially the software developers at Redgate, where I learned about the implementation of safe SQL migrations and provided valuable insights into computer science as a career.
