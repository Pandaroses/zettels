Developing an n-tuple pendulum simulation made me think about the interdisciplinary skills gained with computer science. Initially having covered harmonic motion in a physics lesson and hearing about double pendulums, which are one of the simplest examples of chaotic motion, I did further research on the topic by looking into Euler-Lagrange equations of motion and the Runge Kutta methods for estimating differential equations. I was impressed by Boran Yesilyurt's paper about generalized equations of motion for n-tuple pendulums, as his derivation was a novel solution to the problem of partial derivatives being inaccurate when solved by computational methods. Additionally, seeing proof by induction being used in the field of physics, which I had recently learned during my A-level Further Maths lessons, was fascinating. I ultimately decided to follow Travis Taylor's approach, which used matrix and vector manipulation to estimate the motion of an n-tuple pendulum. In this project iteration, I also implemented the RK4 method instead of Euler's method for increased accuracy, although still susceptible to energy loss. This project demonstrated to me that computing is a valuable tool, converting abstract mathematical models into tangible simulations, allowing for [BOOBS]

I participated in the Arm Work Experience workshop, where we were tasked with developing a mock project to develop essential team-building and problem-solving skills. I was in charge of creating a standard for inter-satellite proximity detection and data transfer using the micro:bit's radio modules. After reviewing feedback from multiple groups and other team members, I implemented changes to improve the proximity detection, changing from high-power radio strength analysis to a lower-power method with a more limited range but a more accurate distance estimate. The skills I learned, particularly in understanding a client's needs, proved helpful when I co-founded a freelancing company with my peers, mainly focusing on B2B software development, generating a projected 4 figures of monthly revenue. 

Community service is a core value of mine. As an explorer scout, teaching younger scouts during electronics nights or helping with Digital Maker badges taught me the beauty of education. In addition, I helped renovate the scout building, which, when looking back on it, makes me glad knowing that my actions will be beneficial in the future, providing a safe and secure place for activities. Additionally, my role as a volunteer organizer for Robocon, a student-led robotics competition, involved website maintenance and development of websocket code for live robot video feeds. During the competition, I interacted with industry professionals, especially the software developers at Redgate, where I learned about the implementation of safe SQL migrations and provided valuable insights into computer science as a career.
