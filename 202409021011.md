# supercurriculars
### gosher studios
- working in a team
- creating for a community 
- making software with a purpose 
- floppa files ( talk about deduplication, speeding it up, iterative testing)
- TODO

generally a good idea to talk about gosher studios, how in a team i was responsible for parts and it taught me about the intricacies of git
### robocon
- helped manage the website
-  volunteered at the events
-  assisted in developing websocket code for shepherd live feed
good to talk about as volunteering is always appreciated for this type of thing, i dont have much to say in the interview, but it might be good to mention as a small thing
### personal projects
- cyclic 
- doubletapp
-  pendulums, talk about cool maths and ACTUALLY FUCKING FINISH IT
-  i LOVE LINUX, talk about me bricking the system and figuring out how to fix it
- started from whuffle & hypixel bots,
- talk about jon grengset <3
- spend entire personal statement talking about keyboard ergonomics

#### pendulums
- recalled harmonic motion from physics, was dissapointed that it was only for small angles,read up on how actual single pendulums work.
- derived a double pendulum on my own with some assistance from teachers and a guide
- attempted to implement a n-tuple pendulum, which led me to a research paper by so&so which described a general lagrangian equation of motion for a n-tuple pendulum, but I couldn't understand the depth of the paper, so my attempted unfortunately ended up in failure, but the failure still had a lot of educational value
- learnt about differential equations
- developped boilerplate code for a n-tuple pendulum
- also simple shader render (TBD)

#### linux
- first experience with linux was as a child, when i helped install lubuntu on my great grandfathers laptop which was the same age as me. using the laptop for personal use made me more confident in my skills & programming as my father had installed python and idle onto the laptop, and left me to my own devices
- afterwards i installed linux on a virtual machine to try out, fell in love with CLI based interfaces as i believed they were easier to use , and after that started dualbooting linux and windows, started off with issues, i.e a windows update removing the bootloader for linux, accidentally pacman -Syyu'ing instead of Syu, but through learning & trial/error reached a system that i now daily drive in multiple environments. found linux easier to use, less cpu intensive & the customizability was beyond anything available on competitor operating systems

#### doubletapp
- having played
- talk about making a cool anticheat & building a community

#### ternary cpu
- awesome 
#### [b]lang / NEA
- after loving rust, but finding it taking long to develop due to slow compile times and strict compiler error checking, decided on trying to make a minimal, but still memory safe language, that could be compatible with my ternary cpu emulator/architecture
	
### studio squared
- fuck knows 

### arm work experience


# extracurriculars
- volunteering with explorers/scouts
- taekwondo
-  climbing (taught me like that there are more than multiple approaches to, even simple problems)
- gym
- robotics & drone club in year 7/8
-  BEBRAS AND UKMT

#### cyclic
- inspiration of cyclic came after studying for the gcses , realizing just reading off of a textbook is a terrible method of learning.
- meowed too hard
- discovered ali abdaals method of retrospective revision, fascinated i used it during exam prep & found it to be effective with getting the grades i aimed for, even reaching #4 in the year in computer science at hills road
- i was cheesed to meet you
- found it ineffective to use a spreadsheet to do retrospective revision, so decided to try making a web app, potentially also monetizable to do save for university
 - allowed me to combine my interests of optimizing learning & programming


#### montesorri experience
- not a 100% certainty whether or not i should add this, but it could be argued that this school taught me the beauty in learning, whereas instead of just learning based on a curriculum, you were encouraged to learn whatever you wanted & thats what i attribute my love of education

#### floppapad/40
- designed with close a friend 
- only related to if i'm applying to cse, which i'm probably not


#### scratch 
- been making simple games in scratch as a child

#### nand2tetris book
talk about reading the book & following it, changing things for my liking later on

#### curriculars
- do a level computer science in school
- been participating in the ukmt,bebras, tried projet euler

to be fare personal statement doesn't seem too scary
