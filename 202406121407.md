# Personal Statements

## the dos
- get to the "meat" of your personal statement quickly, make sure to have it be relevant and linked
- show your academic personality, you need to be passionate, not quirky
-  its recommended to leave your introduction to last
-  quality over quantity, do not vomit every single supercurricular out onto the page
-  say your personal statement out loud, recommended to say it to teachers,parents or any mature person.


## the don'ts
-  do not try to be quirky, the admissions tutors will read your entire personal statement,  trying to catch their attention will not work
-  don't plagiarize other peoples works, should be obvious but in the previous year,  234 people plagiarized the same anecdote, that they "burned a hole in their pajamas" with a chemistry set, and that sparked their passion in the sciences
-  don't start with a cliche, the most common computer science opener was, "i received my first computer at X years old", the tutors do not care about when you got interested in the subject, instead they care about what you did once you got interested
-  keep it simple, stupid. don't try to use extremely fancy words, don't try to fluff up your personal statements with useless words that just make you sound slightly more intelligent.



## the what, so what, now what paragraph structure

### what?
describe what you did, be it a supercurricular or an extracurricular, keep it minimal, do not explain that you were "fortunate" or "lucky" to do this activity, instead state, the activity & what you did

### so what?
explain what ideas were sparked from this activity, did you get stuck on any parts of the activity, did you see a link between another activity that you did, how it affected you.  demonstrate critical thinking.

### now what?
now, you need to show what happened after, this activity, if you read a book on computer science, write how you applied this book, or how you saw it be applied/used in further research or a different task. It could be anything, from being as simple as to listening to another podcast on the topic, to a fully fledged resource paper.

### extra point: how this affected you
this point should be clarified through the entire paragraph, but if need be make sure to explain to the admissions tutors as to how this activity was important to you, and what lasting effects it had on you.

## 80/20 rule

spend 80% of your writing on supercurriculars, refer to the paragraph structure written above,  but leave 20% of your personal statement for extracurriculars. don't try link your extracurriculars to your degree application, but instead try paint yourself as having skills that are useful for general university. 
things you should try link your extracurriculars to:
- resilience
- communication skills
- time management skills
- independence

if you are low on words/space, you do not have to expand on your extracurriculars, you can just briefly mention them insofar your supercurriculars are well and truly covered


## how to get to writing the personal statement

### reflect
write down anything you've done, literally anything, try come up with a few bullet points on activities you've done, or anything in particular.

### plan
pick out the best activities, then start thinking about structuring your personal statement, does not necessarily need to be chronological , but should read well

### draft
start writing your personal statement, no one gets it right on the first try, instead write and write, until you feel comfortable
