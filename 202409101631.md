During my examination preparation, I discovered the method of retrospective revision, which significantly enhanced my studying efficiency. This approach, analogous to the Pareto principle, led to notable academic achievements, including a fourth-place ranking in computer science and commendable results across various subjects.

Motivated by these outcomes, I developed "Cyclic," a suite of applications that integrates retrospective revision with machine learning algorithms. This project not only improved my programming skills but also introduced me to advanced concepts in algorithm analysis. My subsequent exploration of Big O notation and comprehensive study of the CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms) textbook substantially deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithmic efficiency.

A noteworthy undertaking in my studies was the development of an ASCII-rendered n-tuple pendulum simulation. This project progressed from independently deriving single pendulum equations to implementing a double pendulum model using Euler-Lagrange equations and Euler's method for differential equation approximation. Advancing further, I engaged with Boran Yesilyurt's research on generalized n-tuple pendulum motion, despite its complexity. The project culminated in the implementation of Travis Taylor's approach, utilizing the Runge-Kutta 4th order method (RK4) for enhanced accuracy. This endeavor not only deepened my understanding of physical simulations and numerical methods but also exemplified the iterative nature of computational problem-solving in physics.

My involvement with Gosher Studios provided practical experience in collaborative software development. This endeavor enhanced my proficiency in version control systems, particularly Git, and improved my ability to create community-oriented software. A notable project, Floppa Files, presented opportunities to optimize file deduplication processes through iterative testing and performance enhancement techniques.

Extracurricular activities have complemented my academic pursuits. As an Explorer Scout, I have participated in various community service projects, including campsite management, building renovations, and electronics workshops. These experiences have cultivated skills in teamwork and project management. Additionally, my role as a volunteer organizer for Robocon, a student-led competition, involved website maintenance and the development of websocket code for live video feeds. Interactions with industry professionals, particularly software engineers from Redgate, provided valuable insights into the practical applications of computer science in industry settings.

My interest in operating systems led me to extensively explore Linux. Beginning with the installation of Lubuntu on an older computer, I progressed to developing a customized Linux environment for daily use. This journey significantly enhanced my understanding of system architecture and troubleshooting methodologies.

To further challenge myself, I embarked on projects such as creating a ternary CPU emulator and designing a custom programming language, [b]lang, for my Non-Examined Assessment. These endeavors have provided in-depth exposure to low-level computing concepts and principles of language design.

Throughout my academic and extracurricular experiences, I have consistently applied theoretical knowledge to practical projects. From early experiments with Scratch programming to co-directing a small freelancing company, my passion for computer science has been a driving force in my personal and academic development. As I anticipate further education in this field, I am eager to contribute to and advance the discipline of computer science.
