This paper presents a general formulation of equations of motion of a pendulum with n point mass by use of two diﬀerent methods. The ﬁrst one is obtained by using Lagrange Mechanics and mathematical induction(inspection), and the second one is derived by deﬁning a vector. Today, these equations can be obtained by employing numerous programs; however, this study gives a very compact form of these equations that is more eﬃcient than solving Euler-Lagrange Equations for every pendulum with more complex structures than simple or double pendulum. Additionally, we investigate what will happen to our n-point mass system when we take limit as number of point masses goes inﬁnity under well-deﬁned assumptions. We ﬁnd out that it converges to hanging rope system. Keywords: Pendulum, Classical Mechanics 1. Introduction Even though it is not a commonly encountered problem in numerous areas of Physics, double and triple pendulums are examined in the study of chaos and classical mechanics. However, equations of motion of these systems obtained by Lagrange Mechanics can be long and complicated. It is evident that these equations may be acquired with the help of computers today, but the way of obtaining these equations by computers involves taking partial derivatives, which may cause some trouble for higher systems containing more than three point masses. Thus, this new formulation of equations of motion of n-point mass pendulum systems might quicken this process. By doing so, it may help the study of chaos in these particular systems. The pendulum systems which we will investigate in this paper consists of point masses and movable joints. After we obtain the general formula, we will examine the small oscillations.arXiv:1910.12610v2 [physics.class-ph] 8 Feb 2020 Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 2 Figure 1. A Simple Pendulum 2. First Way of Derivation The derivation of the ﬁnal form of the formula will be mainly based on induction. Let us start with the Lagrangian and equations of motion of simple pendulum and double pendulum. According to 1 ¨θ + g l sin(θ) = 0 (1) L = T − U = 1 2 ml2 ˙θ2 + mgl cos(θ) (2) These are the aforementioned equations for simple pendulum[1]. Before we give the equations for double pendulum 2, we need to clarify some points. x1 = l1 sin(θ1) (3) y1 = −l1 cos(θ1) (4) x2 = l1 sin(θ1) + l2 sin(θ2) (5) y2 = −(l1 cos(θ1) + l2 cos(θ2)) (6) Above four formulas give the positions of point masses. Then, for the ﬁrst point mass dx1 = l1 cos(θ1)dθ1 and dy1 = l1sin(θ1)dθ1 (7) Thus, (dx1/dt) 2 + (dy1/dt) 2 = l2 1 ˙θ12 (8) Hence K1 = 1 2m1l2 1 ˙θ12 (9) Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 3 Also, U1 = −m1gl1 cos(θ1) (10) Consequently, L1 = K1 − U1 = 1 2 m1l2 1 ˙θ12 + m1gl1 cos(θ1). (11) Now, dx2 = l1 cos(θ1)dθ1 + l2 cos(θ2)dθ2 (12) dy2 = l1 sin(θ1)dθ1 + l2 sin(θ2)dθ2 (13) Then, (dx2/dt) 2 + (dy2/dt) 2 = l2 1 ˙θ1 + l2 2 ˙θ22 + 2l1l2 cos(θ1 − θ2) ˙θ1 ˙θ2 (14) Hence, K2 = 1 2 m2(l2 1 ˙θ1 + l2 2 ˙θ22 + l1l2 cos(θ1 − θ2) ˙θ1 ˙θ2) (15) U2 = −m2g(l1 cos(θ1) + l2 cos(θ2)) (16) Consequently, L2 = K2−U2 = 1 2 m2(l2 1 ˙θ1+l2 2 ˙θ22+2l1l2 cos(θ1−θ2) ˙θ1 ˙θ2)+m2g(l1 cos(θ1)+l2 cos(θ2)) (17) Figure 2. A Double Pendulum Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 4 Then, the lagrangian of double pendulum is L = L1 + L2 = 1 2 m1l2 1 ˙θ12 + m1gl1 cos(θ1) + 1 2 m2(l2 1 ˙θ1 + l2 2 ˙θ22 + 2l1l2 cos(θ1 − θ2) ˙θ1 ˙θ2) + m2g(l1 cos(θ1) + l2 cos(θ2)) (18) Then by solving Euler-Lagrange Equations ( d dt ( ∂L ∂ ˙q ) − ∂L ∂q = 0) for θ1, we get (m1+m2)l2 1 ¨θ1+m2l1l2 ¨θ2cos(θ1−θ2)+m2l1l2 ˙θ22sin(θ1−θ2)+(m1+m2)l1g sin(θ1) = 0 (19) and for θ2, we get m2l2 2 ¨θ2 + m2l1l2 ¨θ1 cos(θ1 − θ2) − m2l1l2 ˙θ12 sin(θ1 − θ2) + m2l2g sin(θ2) = 0 (20) The above formulas are the equations of motion of double pendulum [1]. Now, we will start to write Lagrangian of triple pendulum shown in 3 , and then, we will obtain the equation of motion of triple pendulum. These equations for simple pendulum, double pendulum, and triple pendulum will guide us to derive our ﬁnal equation. Firstly, x1 = l1 sin(θ1) y1 = −l1 cos(θ1) (21) x2 = l1 sin(θ1) + l2 sin(θ2) y2 = −(l1 cos(θ1) + l2 cos(θ2)) (22) x3 = l1 sin(θ1) + l2 sin(θ2) + l3 sin(θ3) y3 = −(l1 cos(θ1) + l2 cos(θ2) + l3 cos(θ3)) (23) From 2 and 18, we know the Lagrangian of simple and double pendulum. Then, dx3 = cos(θ1)l1dθ1 + cos(θ2)l2dθ2 + cos(θ3)l3dθ3 (24) dy3 = sin(θ1)l1dθ1 + sin(θ2)l2dθ2 + sin(θ3)l3dθ3 (25) Thus, (dx3) 2 + (dy3) 2 = l2 1(dθ1)2 + l2 2(dθ2) 2 + l2 3(dθ3) 2 + 2l1l2 cos(θ1 − θ2)dθ1dθ2 + (θ1 − θ3)dθ1dθ3 + 2l2l3 cos(θ2 − θ3)dθ2dθ3 (26) Consequently, K3 = 1 2m3(l2 1( ˙θ1)2 + l2 2( ˙θ2) 2 + l2 3( ˙θ3)2 + 2l1l2 cos(θ1 − θ2) ˙θ1 ˙θ2+ 2l1l3 cos(θ1 − θ3) ˙θ1 ˙θ3 + 2l2l3 cos(θ2 − θ3) ˙θ2 ˙θ3) (27) U3 = −m3g(l1 cos(θ1) + l2 cos(θ2) + l3 cos(θ3)) (28) . Then, we get L3 = K3 − U3‡ (29) ‡ Since equation is very long, we give it implicitly. Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 5 Figure 3. A Triple Pendulum The Lagrangian of triple pendulum can be written as L = L1 + L2 + L3. If we want to write equation of motion of triple pendulum, we will write it with respect to θ1, θ2 and θ3 by use of Euler-Lagrange equation d dt ( ∂L ∂ ˙q ) − ∂L ∂q = 0. For θ1, gl1(m1 sin(θ1) + m2 sin(θ1) + m3 sin(θ1)) + m2l1l2 sin(θ1 − θ2) ˙θ1 ˙θ2 + m3l1l3 sin(θ1 − θ3) ˙θ1 ˙θ3 + m3l1l2 sin(θ1 − θ2) ˙θ1 ˙θ2 + l2 1 ¨θ1(m1 + m2 + m3) + m2l1l2[sin(θ2 − θ1)( ˙θ1 − ˙θ2) ˙θ2 + cos(θ1 − θ2) ¨θ2] + m3l1l2[sin(θ2 − θ1)( ˙θ1 − ˙θ2) ˙θ2 + cos(θ1 − θ2) ¨θ2] + m3l1l3[sin(θ3 − θ1)( ˙θ1 − ˙θ3) ˙θ3 + cos(θ1 − θ3) ¨θ3] = 0 (30) Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 6 For θ2, gl2(m2 sin(θ2) + m3 sin(θ2)) + ˙θ1 ˙θ2l1l2 sin(θ2 − θ1)[m2 + m3] + m3l2l3 sin(θ2 − θ3) ˙θ2 ˙θ3 + l2 2 ¨θ2(m2 + m3) + (m2 + m3)l1l2[sin(θ2 − θ1)( ˙θ1 − ˙θ2) ˙θ1 + cos(θ2 − θ1) ¨θ1] + m3l2l3[sin(θ3 − θ2)( ˙θ2 − ˙θ3) ˙θ3 + cos(θ2 − θ3) ¨θ3] = 0 (31) For θ3, m3gl3 sin(θ3) − m3l2l3 sin(θ2 − θ3) ˙θ2 ˙θ3 − m3l1l3 sin(θ1 − θ3) ˙θ1 ˙θ3 + m3l1l3[sin(θ3 − θ1)( ˙θ1 − ˙θ3) ˙θ1 + cos(θ1 − θ3) ¨θ1] + m3l2l3[sin(θ3 − θ2)( ˙θ2 − ˙θ3) ˙θ2 + cos(θ2 − θ3) ¨θ2] + m3l2 3 ¨θ3 = 0 (32) Now, it can be seen that the terms in the equation of motion of simple, double and triple pendulum may be grouped. Also, if we can understand the behaviour of the terms which consists of cosine and sine functions, we can predict what kind of terms will occur in the equation of motion of pendulums that contains more than three point masses. Now, we will analyse the terms in the equation of motion of triple pendulum. Firstly, the term gljsin(θj)mk is common in all the equations. However, the mass varies in three equation. 30 has m1, m2, m3. But when we look at 31, we lost m1,and when we look at 32, we lost m2. Let θj indicates the coordinates and j = 1, 2, 3. Then by deﬁning a function, call σjk, we can create this pattern in a sum. σjk = { 0 j > k 1 j ≤ k Therefore, n=3∑ k=1 glj sin(θj)mkσjk (33) can give us the required terms when n=3 for triple pendulum. Moreover, m3l2 3 ¨θ3 appears in three equation with same trend as we discussed for 33. Thus, we can formulate it in the same manner by again using σjk. n=3∑ k=1 mkl2 j ¨θjσjk. (34) In fact, we are now left with 2 diﬀerent kind of terms. The ﬁrst is m3l1l3 sin(θ1 − θ3) ˙θ1 ˙θ3 appearing in 32. It can be seen that it consists of a θj1 and its combinations with θj2 and θj3(the same θjt do not appear twice) from 30,31,32. Now by following the trend we can make a formulation. It is n=3∑ k=1( n=3∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk sin(θj − θk) ˙θj ˙θk (35) We dealt with minus signs by changing the order of arguments of sine function. Also, the last terms is the one m3l2l3[sin(θ3 − θ2)( ˙θ2 − ˙θ3) ˙θ2 + cos(θ2 − θ3) ¨θ2]. The way Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 7 they appear in 30,31,32 and general trend is similar.Thus, we can use a similar manner to derive o formula. Nevertheless, we need to deﬁne a new function, φjk, to prevent the case when cos(0) in our formulation. The new function is φjk = { 0 j = k 1 j ̸= k Then the formulation is n=3∑ k=1( n=3∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk[sin(θk − θj)[ ˙θj − ˙θk] ˙θk + φjk cos(θj − θk) ¨θk] (36) Now, we will give the ﬁnal form of our formulation for triple pendulum (n=3), and then, we will do the discussion for generalization of this formulation. The ﬁnal form is n=3∑ k=1 (glj sin(θj)mkσjk + mkl2 j ¨θjσjk + ( n=3∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk sin(θj − θk) ˙θj ˙θk + ( n=3∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk[sin(θk − θj)[ ˙θj − ˙θk] ˙θk + φjk cos(θj − θk) ¨θk] ) = 0 (37) Firstly, we can generalize 33 and 34 directly to n. The term in 33 is obtained from the partial derivative of Lagrangian with respect to the θj ,and its anti-derivative comes from the potential. Thus, it will appear in the same form as we formulated in eq.18. Moreover, the term in 34 is obtained from the partial derivative of Lagrangian with respect to the ˙θj, and total derivative with respect to time. Also its anti-derivative comes from the kinetic energy expression.Therefore, its trend of appearing in equation of motion for higher point masses will be the same with the 34. To understand how 35 will behave for an arbitrary n, we need ﬁrst to consider where the cosine subtraction form comes. For an arbitrary n , (dxn) = ∑n i=1 li cos(θi)dθi and (dyn) = ∑n i=1 lisin(θi)dθi.Thus, (dxn) 2 + (dyn)2 consists of only l2 i dθ2 i and the combination of 2lklm cos(θk − θm)dθkdθm,where 1 ≤ m < k ≤ n. We obtain the term in 35 from the partial derivative of Lagrangian with respect to the θj, and we use ∑n=3 q≥k mqσjq to arrange masses. Consequently, we can directly generalize n to an arbitrary n where n > 0. The last terms represented in 36 is also comes from the same anti-derivative, but it is obtained from the partial derivative of Lagrangian with respect to the ˙θj, and total derivative with respect to time. Because of the same reasons, we can generalize it to an arbitrary n. A crucial point is whether there will be extra new terms for higher n’s. Actually, we grouped our terms in four ,and we know where they come. When we generalize these terms to n, the resulting Lagrangian will be in the same form. Therefore, we will see the same types of terms when we put our Lagrangian into Euler-Lagrange Equation. Because of these reasons, we can safely say Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 8 that there will be no new terms for higher n values. The equation is n∑ k=1 (glj sin(θj)mkσjk + mkl2 j ¨θjσjk + ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk sin(θj − θk) ˙θj ˙θk + ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk[sin(θk − θj)[ ˙θj − ˙θk] ˙θk + φjkcos(θj − θk) ¨θk] ) = 0 (38) 3. Second Way of Derivation§ In this section, we will try to obtain the same equation by using another method. Assume that we have a pendulum as illustrated in 4 and n point masses. Let us deﬁne a vector ⃗rn = ln sin(θn)ˆx − ln cos(θn)ˆy. Then ⃗Rn = n∑ i=1 ⃗rn (39) ˙⃗Rn = n∑ i=1 li ˙θi(cos θi ˆx + sin θi ˆy) (40) To be able to write kinetic energy expression, we need | ˙⃗Rn| 2. Thus, | ˙⃗Rn| 2 = ⃗Rn · ⃗Rn = n∑ i,j=1 lilj ˙θi ˙θj cos(θi − θj) (41) Consequently, the kinetic energy and potential expressions are T = n∑ k=1 1 2mk| ˙⃗Rn| 2 (42) U = n∑ i=1 Ui = −g n∑ i=1 mi i∑ j=1 lj cos θj (43) Then, the Lagrangian of the system is L = T − U = n∑ k=1 1 2mk| ˙⃗Rn| 2 + g n∑ i=1 mi i∑ j=1 lj cos θj (44) Now, let us ﬁnd equations of motion for an arbitrary θq (q ≤ n). d dt( ∂L ∂ ˙θq ) − ∂L ∂θq = − ∂T ∂θq + ∂(U ) ∂θq + d dt ( ∂T ∂ ˙θq ) = 0 (45) Thus, we have ∂(U ) ∂θq = g n∑ i=q milq sin(θq) (46.1) § I would like to thank Professor Altug Ozpineci for his great contributions to this section. Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 9 Figure 4. A Pendulum system with n point masses − ∂T ∂θq = − ∂ ∂θq ( n∑ k=1 1 2mk k∑ i,j=1 lilj ˙θi ˙θjcos(θi − θj) ) = n∑ k=q mk k∑ i=1 lilq ˙θi ˙θq sin(θq − θi) (46.2) Now, we have two special case in kinetic energy expression 41. The ﬁrst one is when i = j , and this one gives terms in the form of 1 2mv2,which contains ˙θi2 terms, and the second case is when i ̸= j.Thus, we will investigate d dt ( ∂T ∂ ˙θq ) in two diﬀerent parts. Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 10 When i = j, d dt ( ∂ ∂ ˙θq ( n∑ k=1 1 2 mk k∑ i=j=1 lilj ˙θi ˙θj cos(θi − θj))) = n∑ k=q mklq2 ¨θq (46.3) When i ̸= j, d dt ( ∂ ∂ ˙θq ( n∑ k=1 1 2 mk k∑ i,j=1 lilj ˙θi ˙θj cos(θi − θj))) = n∑ k=q mk k∑ i=1 lilq ˙θi ˙θq sin(θi − θq)[ ˙θq − ˙θi] + n∑ k=q mk k∑ i=1 lilq cos(θi − θq) ¨θi (46.4) Since we indicate that i ̸= j, the cases cos(0) and sin(0) are automatically prevented in 46.4. Nevertheless, we cannot prevent cos(0) case when q = i. To solve this problem, we need to deﬁne φiq function, which we deﬁned in the previous section. When we group 46.1,46.2,46.3 and 46.4, we acquire the equations of motion for an arbitrary θq g n∑ i=q milq sin(θq) + n∑ k=q mk k∑ i=1 lilq ˙θi ˙θq sin(θq − θi) + n∑ k=q mklq2 ¨θq + n∑ k=q mk k∑ i=1 lilq ˙θi ˙θqsin(θi − θq)[ ˙θq − ˙θi] + n∑ k=q mk k∑ i=1 lilqφiq cos(θi − θq) ¨θi = 0 (46) When 46 is compared with 38, they are exactly the same except summation form. This is because we use a function called σjk and φjk to write the formula in a compact one big summation; however, we have double sums in 46. Also, 46 can be written in the parenthesis of a general sum. Since i is a dummy index in 46.1, replace it with k. Now it can be written in the form of n∑ k=q (gmklq sin(θq) + mk k∑ i=1 lilq ˙θi ˙θq sin(θq − θi) + mklq2 ¨θq + mk k∑ i=1 lilq ˙θi ˙θq sin(θi − θq)[ ˙θq − ˙θi] + mk k∑ i=1 lilqφiq cos(θi − θq) ¨θi) = 0 (47) Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 11 4. Investigation of Small Oscillations In this section, we will basically consider that given θj’s are suﬃciently small to do small angle approximation, and try to see whether it is matching with the small angle approximation used for simple, double and other pendulum systems. That is, we will assume the followings sin(θ) ≈ θ, (48) cos(θ) ≈ 1 − θ2 2 (49) Then, n∑ k=1 (gljθjmkσjk + mkl2 j ¨θjσjk + ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk(θj − θk) ˙θj ˙θk+ ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk[(θk − θj)( ˙θj − ˙θk) ˙θk + φjk(1 − (θj − θk) 2 2 ) ¨θk] ) = n∑ k=1 (θj(gljmkσjk) + mkl2 j ¨θjσjk + θj( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk ˙θk2+ ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk[−θk ˙θk2 + φjk ¨θk − φjk ¨θk θ2 j 2 − φjk ¨θk θ2 k 2 + θkθjφjk ¨θk]) = 0 (50) We have n∑ k=1 (θj(gljmkσjk) + mkl2 j ¨θjσjk + ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlkθj ˙θk2+ ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk[−θk ˙θk2 + φjk ¨θk − φjk ¨θk θ2 j 2 − φjk ¨θk θ2 k 2 + θkθjφjk ¨θk]) = 0 (51) In the case of simple pendulum, we have n = 1 and j = 1. For n = 1 and j = 1, θ1gl1m1 + m1l2 1 ¨θ1 + θ1m1l2 1 ˙θ12 − θ1m1l2 1 ˙θ12 + 0 − 0 − 0 + 0 = θ1gl1m1 + m1l2 1 ¨θ1 = 0 ⇒ ¨θ1 + g l θ1 = 0 (52) In the case of double pendulum, we have n = 2 and j = 1, 2. For j = 1, gl1θ1m1 + m1l2 1 ¨θ1 + θ1(m1 + m2)l2 1 ˙θ2 1 − (m1 + m2)θ1 ˙θ12l2 1 + θ1gl1m2+ m2l2 1 ¨θ1 + θ1m2l1l2 ˙θ22 − m2l1l2θ2 ˙θ22 + (m2)l1l2( ¨θ2 − θ2 1 2 ¨θ2 − θ2 2 2 ¨θ2 + θ1θ2 ¨θ2) = 0 (53) Therefore, it can be seen that the the results are matching and we successfully manage to obtain general version of small angle approximation for pendulum systems by using 38. Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 12 5. An Analysis on Inﬁnite Number of Point Masses We will start with 51. First of all we want to analyze our n-point mass system under small oscillations and we know that at small angles we may represent our system as a system of linear equations. However, we have still non-linear terms in 51. Now consider the terms θj ˙θk2 and −θk ˙θk2 − φjk ¨θk θ2 j 2 − φjk ¨θk θ2 k 2 + θkθjφjk ¨θk in 51. Since any θj is very small(θj << 1), all the terms containing multiplication of several arbitrary θj and their derivatives can be neglected. Thus, the terms indicated above vanishes, and we are left with n∑ k=1 (θj(gljmkσjk) + mkl2 j ¨θjσjk + ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlkφjk ¨θk) = 0 (54) Now, we will set our assumptions. • Assume that we have initially an n-point mass pendulum system. • Let l1 = l2 = .... = ln = l and m1 = m2 = .... = mn = m . • The total length of the system is L = ∑n i=1 li = nl.(l is the length of the line segment which connects adjacent point masses.) • The total length of the system is M = ∑n i=1 mi = nm. • For any θj(1 ≤ j ≤ n), θj << 1. • By ﬁfth and second assumptions, θj = (xj − xj−1)/l At this stage, the mass density(not continuous) of our system is µ = M L (55) Our aim is to take limit as n → ∞. To do so, we need to re-arrange 54 and construct a well-deﬁned system. Thus, we will re-deﬁne some terms. Our limit approach will be based on sequential concepts. We increase n by inserting a new point mass between every two point mass, so each step the total number of point masses grows in power of two. By following these steps, l becomes half of its previous value in each steps. Nevertheless, we have no control on mass of individual point masses. Consequently as n → ∞, M → ∞. Thus, µ → ∞ ,which is very problematic situation. Therefore, we must do some sequential deﬁnitions. That is • (np) = n2 p ,where p = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and n is the initial number of point masses in our system. • (lp) = l/2 p, where p = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and l is the initial length of a line segment between point masses in our system. • (mp) = m/2 p, where p = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and m is the initial mass of a point mass in our system. All of these deﬁnitions indicate that while we are increasing n in each step, we must reduce m and l values to half of their values in previous step. Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 13 Now, one can observe that when we take limit of µ as p → ∞(total number of point masses → ∞), the mass density stays constant and since l → 0 it has the same value in any segment of our system. However, we still do not know what kind of a system it will be. Before starting taking limits, we must do necessary arrangements in our equation. The ﬁrst sum in 54 can be written as n∑ k=1 θjgljmkσjk = n∑ k=1 glmσjk (xj − xj−1) l = (n − j + 1)mlg (xj − xj−1) l (56) The second sum in 54 can be written as n∑ k=1 ¨θjl2 j mkσjk = n∑ k=1 l2mσjk ( ¨xj − ¨xj−1) l = (n − j + 1)ml2 ( ¨xj − ¨xj−1) l (57) For the third term we need to investigate summation in two cases because of the natures φ and σ functions. The ﬁrst case is when k < j. It may be written as j−1∑ k=1( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlkφjk ¨θk = j−1∑ k=1 ml2(n − j + 1) ( ¨xk − ¨xk−1) l (58) For k = 1, we have x0 = 0. Hence, the sum is j−1∑ k=1( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlkφjk ¨θk = (n − j + 1)ml2 ¨xj−1 l (59) When k > j, n∑ k=j+1 ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlkφjk ¨θk = ml2 l ((n − j)(¨xj+1 − ¨xj) + (n − j − 1)(¨xj+2 − ¨xj+1) + n∑ k=j+3 (n − k + 1)(¨xk − ¨xk−1)) = ml2 l (−(n − j)¨xj + ¨xj+1 + (n − j − 1)¨xj+2 + n∑ k=j+3 (n − k + 1)(¨xk − ¨xk−1)) (60) As one can observe, there will be another ¨xj+2 term when we expand the summation one more step and that sum will reduce the coeﬃcient of ¨xj+2 to 1. After some algebra, the coeﬃcient of ¨θk’s will be 1. Therefore, our summation becomes equal to very simple expression n∑ k=j+1 ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlkφjk ¨θk = ml2 l (−(n − j)¨xj + n∑ k=j+1 ¨xk) (61) Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 14 Now, let us substitute 56, 57, 59 and 61 into 54. We have (n − j + 1)mlg (xj − xj−1) l + (n − j + 1)ml2 ( ¨xj − ¨xj−1) l + (n − j + 1)ml2 ¨xj−1 l + ml2 l (−(n − j)¨xj + n∑ k=j+1 ¨xk)s = 0 (62) After cancellations, (n − j + 1)mlg (xj − xj−1) l + ml2 l ¨xj + ml2 l n∑ k=j+1 ¨xk = 0 (63) Observe that ml2 l n∑ k=j ¨xk = −(n − j + 1)mlg (xj − xj−1) l (64) Let us substitute 64 into 63. Since j is dummy index in 64, let j = j + 1 to obtain correct indices after substitution. Moreover, divide 63 with ml. Consequently, we have ¨xj − (n − j)g (xj+1 − xj) l + (n − j + 1)g (xj − xj−1) l = 0 (65) Also, we can say that xj may be expressed as a function of y and t. Let us substitute n and l in their sequential forms. Then, after some algebra, we have ¨xj = g[((np) − j)(xj+1 − 2xj + xj−1) (lp) − (xj − xj−1) (lp) ] (66) Let us start taking limit as p → ∞. Firstly, lim p→∞ ¨xj = ∂2x(y, t) ∂t2 (67) As p → ∞, (np) → ∞. Thus, our system becomes a continuous system since lim p→∞(xj+1 − xj) = 0 (68) Consequently, ¨xj is an arbitrary point on the graph of ∂2x(y, t)/∂t2 and above limit is valid. Now, consider the following lim p→∞ (xj − xj−1) (lp) = lim p→∞ (xj − xj−1) (l/2p) (69) Since xj and xj−1 diﬀer by l/2 p and l/2 p,say h, goes zero as p goes inﬁnity. Above limit is nothing but limit deﬁnition of ﬁrst partial derivative of x(y, t) with respect to y at any point in the domain of x(y, t) since j is arbitrary. Ergo, lim p→∞ (xj − xj−1) (l/2p) = ∂x(y, t) ∂y (70) Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 15 Moreover, observe that lim p→∞ ((np)(lp) − (lp)j) = L − y (71) We must add y term since (lp)j will give us y-coordinate value of jth point. There will be inﬁnitely many points on our system and (lp) will be inﬁnitely small. Hence, lim p→∞ ((np) − j)(xj+1 − 2xj + xj−1) (lp) = lim p→∞((np) − j)(lp) (lp) (xj+1 − 2xj + xj−1) (lp) (72) By following the same manner we followed for 70, we will obtain lim p→∞((np) − j)(lp) (lp) (xj+1 − 2xj + xj−1) (lp) = (L − y)∂2x(y, t) ∂y2 (73) Finally, we retrieve the following by taking limit of both sides in 66. ∂2x(y, t) ∂t2 = g(L − y)∂2x(y, t) ∂y2 − g ∂x(y, t) ∂y (74) As one can conclude, we have obtained a wave equation. However, it is in an unusual form. At the beginning of this section, we had no idea what we will see after the calculations. Fortunately, our limits happen to exist, and we have a reliable outcome. Further analysis of 74 can be done by using separation of variables method. After the calculations, we will have two ordinary diﬀerential equations. Now, we will demonstrate those calculations; however, we will not investigate the solutions since we are not interested in what type of solutions that our equations yield in this paper as our motive is to create a general and analytical analysis on this subject. But ﬁrst, let us investigate what we have found in 74. After seeing the wave equation, we may have a candidate, and it may be the equation of motion of hanging rope with constant mass density. To conﬁrm that we can use Euler-Lagrange Equation for continuous systems [2] in the case of hanging rope with constant mass density. In this part, we will use our variables and notations to be able to compare the results. The Euler-Lagrange Equation is d dt ∂L ∂ ∂x ∂t + d dy ∂L ∂ ∂x ∂y − ∂L ∂x = 0 (75) , where L is our Lagrange Density. The Lagrangian is in the form of L = ∫ dT − ∫ dU (76) The potential energy of an inﬁnitesimal piece of rope, say dU , might be found by using tension force due to the rope part below our inﬁnitesimal piece. Thus, it can be written as dl = (1 + 1 2 (∂x ∂y ) 2)dy dh = 1 2(∂x ∂y )2dy ⇒ dU = mbelowgdh = g(L − y)µ1 2 (∂x ∂y )2dy (77) Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 16 Similarly, the kinetic energy of that inﬁnitesimal piece is dT = 1 2mv2 = 1 2µdl(∂x ∂t ) 2 (78) Since we are interested in oscillations with small angles, dl → dy. Consequently, dT = 1 2 mv2 = 1 2 µdy(∂x ∂t ) 2 (79) After substituting dT and dU in 76 and setting integral boundaries to 0 and L, we have 1 2 ∫ L 0 ( µ(∂x ∂t ) 2 − g(L − y)µ(∂x ∂y )2) dy (80) The integrand is the Lagrange Density L. We will skip the part of taking this integral and other algebraic arrangements and give the result directly. It is ∂2x(y, t) ∂t2 = g(L − y)∂2x(y, t) ∂y2 − g ∂x(y, t) ∂y (81) This is exactly the same equation with 74! Consequently, this proves our arguments and concludes that when we have an n-point mass pendulum system with well-deﬁned properties, the limit of this system as number of point masses goes inﬁnity will yield the equation of motion of a hanging rope with constant mass density. Thus, our system will start moving exactly as a hanging rope, and this ends our analysis on this section. We have ﬁnished our analysis, but let us present more information concerning 74. Firstly, we will attack by using separation of variables. Thus, let x(y, t) = Ψ(y)ξ(t) (82) After substituting it into equation and diving both sides by Ψ(y)ξ(t), we get 1 ξ d2ξ dt2 = g Ψ ((L − y)d2Ψ dy2 − dΨ dy ) = −K (83) Thus, we have two ordinary diﬀerential equations. The ﬁrst one is d 2ξ dt2 + Kξ = 0 (84) ,which is very familiar equation. The second one is (L − y)d 2Ψ dy2 − dΨ dy + K g Ψ = 0 (85) We will not go into details, but after using h 2 = 1 g (L − y) substitution, one obtains the zeroth order Bessel’s Equation. These have crucial importance for solutions of this system. Equations of Motion Formulation of a Pendulum Containing N-point Masses 17 As we have pointed out before, this wave equation is in an unfamiliar form. At ﬁrst glance, it may look strange; however, it is not. Firstly, origin of the term g ∂x(y,t) ∂y in 74 can be traced back. In fact, it comes from our gravitational potential term. This implies whenever our system is in gravitational potential, this term must appear. Moreover, terms in the right-hand side of 74 are multiplied by g. This indicates that when there is no gravitational potential, the system will stay in its initial state since there will be no restoring force or tension. Also, it is not going to move unless it has an initial velocity. These all are matching with the 74. Now, all those strange terms can be understood as gravitational eﬀects on our systems. Similarly, similar terms appear in the hanging chain problem. 6. Conclusion In this work, it is shown that the equations of motion of a pendulum containing n point masses can be formulated for an arbitrary value of n (n > 0) by using two diﬀerent methods. The equation for an arbitrary θj (j ≤ n) is n∑ k=1 (glj sin(θj)mkσjk + mkl2 j ¨θjσjk + ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk sin(θj − θk) ˙θj ˙θk + ( n∑ q≥k mqσjq)ljlk[sin(θk − θj)[ ˙θj − ˙θk] ˙θk + φjk cos(θj − θk) ¨θk] ) = 0 (86) Additionally, we have shown that by constructing well-deﬁned assumptions and taking limit, our n-point mass pendulum system converges to a hanging rope.
