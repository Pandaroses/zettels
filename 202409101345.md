# 3x3 matrix  determinants, inverses & inverse rules

to find the determinant or inverse of a matrix,  there are a few important things of note. first the **cofactor** of the matrix, which is shown below, this is used for determinants and inverses
$$ mat( +,-,+; -,+,-; +,-,+)$$
the cofactor can also be written as 

$$ $cofactor of $ (i,j) =  (-1)^(i*j) $$
where $i,j$ are the coordinates inside the matrix.

additionally the **minor** of an element $i,j$ in the 3x3 matrix N is the 2x2 matrix, which is not in the rows or column i,j. an example is shown below

Minor of $1,2$ of matrix A 
$$A = mat(a,b,c; d,e,f; g,h,i)$$ 
is equal to $$min(1,2) =  mat(e,f;h,i)$$
this can be used to calculate the determinant of the matrix, after choosing a row or column to follow

$$ det(A) =  (-1)^(1,2)*A(1,2)*det(min(1,2)) + (-1)^(2*2)*A(2,2)*det(min(2,2)) + \  (-1)^(3*2)*A(3,2)*det(min(3,2)) $$


to find the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, you do some magic

$$ A^-1 = 1/det(A) * N^t$$
where N is the matrix of the determinants of minors multiplied by cofactors of A, which is then transposed
