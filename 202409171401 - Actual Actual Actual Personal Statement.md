- intro is bad, need to rewrite and link

Developing an n-tuple pendulum simulation made me think about the interdisciplinary skills gained with computer science. Having covered harmonic motion in a physics lesson,I was introduced to double pendulums - one of the simplest examples of chaotic motion. After learning about Euler-Lagrange equations and the Runge Kutta methods for estimating solutions to initial value differential equations, I derived and implemented a double pendulum myself using Euler's method. Being curious, I decided to do further research into n-tuple pendulums. Implementing Travis Taylor's approach, which used matrix manipulation to estimate the motion of the pendulum, albeit each rod being of a fixed length. Additionally, I implemented the RK4 method for increased accuracy, although still susceptible to energy loss. After further reading of Boran Yesilyurts about a generalized equation of motion, which presented a novel to computational inaccuracies when calculating partial derivatives,. Additionally, seeing proof by induction being used in physics, which I recently learned in Further Maths, demonstrated that computer science is a valuable tool, allowing scientists to convert abstract mathematical models into accurate, tangible simulations. [talk about leapfrog method?]

- potentially replace with v1, or rewrite.


n-tuple pendulum -> learning harmonics -> double pendulum -> eulerlagrange & runge kutta -> did myself -> implemented travis taylor -> read boran paper ->

I love learning. I go out of my way to thoroughly understand topics, or  things I discover while working on projects. One such example is my passion for optimising the learning process. I found the retrospective revision method helpful in my studies, but since it lacks short term accountability I combined it with the FSRS algorithm for spaced repetition, and the Pomodoro technique, which are particularly strong in that regard. This led me to develop an app,in which, in addition to the methods above, I implemented exam spacing, which helps students effectively distribute limited practice questions. The results of a trial with a cohort of students demonstrated improved time utilization and higher knowledge retention. Through this project, being curious about the libraries i used, I watched Jon Gjengsets "decrusting" series,  which provided deeper understandings of code i was previously taking for granted.


- i don't like how it flows, might rewrite v1 instead
-------------------------------------------------------------

potential paragraphs to replace either cyclic or pendulums:

- floppa files: had a need for a file sharing service -> while developing programming skills iterated through project multiple times (OPTIONAL) -> in current iteration i developed my own deduplication method -> (if removing cyclic paragraph) talk about jon gjengset decrusting axum and tokio, also warut suksompong

- epq: being interested in keyboards: link with floppa40 and floppapad (not doing cse so unsure about this) -> machine learning is really interesting -> created keyboard layout generator -> reading research papers blah blah blah parallelization and async optimizations to do like 8x improvement -> conclusion TBD

- doubletapp: wanting to do a skill based game -> some other stuff -> read research paper and implemented wasm random number generator (better linked than pendulums to CS, but simpler) -> people actually want to play it -> makes me happy

Participating in Arm work experience, we were tasked with developing a mock project to develop essential team-building and problem-solving skills. I was in charge of creating a standard for inter-satellite proximity detection and data transfer using the micro:bit's radio modules. After reviewing feedback from multiple groups and other team members, I implemented changes to improve the proximity detection, changing from high-power radio strength analysis to a lower-power method with a more limited range but a more accurate distance estimate. The skills I learned, particularly in understanding a client's needs, proved useful when I co-founded a freelancing company with my peers, mainly focusing on *B2B* software development, [YAP]

Community service is a core value of mine. As an explorer scout, I shared my passion for education by teaching during electronics nights or helping with Digital Maker badges. In addition, I helped renovate the scout building, ensuring it will serve as a safe and secure place for future  activities. Furthermore, my role as a volunteer organizer for Robocon, a student-led robotics competition, involved website maintenance and the development of websocket code for live robot video feeds. During the competition, I interacted with industry professionals, especially the software developers at Redgate, where I learned about the implementation of safe SQL migrations and provided valuable insights into computer science as a career.

**relatively happy with these 2 paragraphs**


intro: something something i like cs pendulums: i can code and i like combining different subjects i see the links yada yada i read research papers and can critically think cyclic: i have a passion for learning and teaching others how to learn; i also know how to write academically and want to dig deeper into things i use arm work experience: yada yada i did cool stuff -> s^2 extracurriculars: yada yada community service scouts,robocon,redgate -> short conclusion
